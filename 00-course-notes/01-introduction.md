* Basically it's a bundling tool

* Bundles up our source code into a web optimized output folder ready for distribution
* Can be used for many different types of projects
* E.g., a React project where we write JSX templates and that JSX needs to be compiled into regular JavaScript before it's served to the browser, multiple JavaScript files which need to be compiled into a single output file before being served, or SASS files that need to be converted to CSS
